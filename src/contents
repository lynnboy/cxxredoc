The [=Cpp] standard library provides definitions for the following types of
entities: macros, values, types, templates, classes, functions, objects.

[para]
[:en]
All library entities except macros, [`operator new] and [`operator delete] are
defined within the namespace [`std] or namespaces nested within namespace
[`std].

[footnote]
[:en]
The C standard library headers (Annex [#depr.c.headers]) also define
names within the global namespace, while the [=Cpp] headers for C library
facilities ([#headers]) may also define names within the global namespace.

[%namespace]
It is unspecified whether names declared in a specific namespace are declared
directly in that namespace or in an inline namespace inside that namespace.

[footnote]
[:en]
This gives implementers freedom to use inline namespaces to support multiple
configurations of the library.
[footnote:end]

[para]
[:en]
Whenever a name [`x] defined in the standard library is mentioned, the name [`x]
is assumed to be fully qualified as [`::std::x], unless explicitly described
otherwise.

[:en]
For example, if the Effects section for library function [`F] is described as
calling library function [`G], the function [`::std::G] is meant.
