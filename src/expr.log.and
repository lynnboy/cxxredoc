[para]
[:en]
The [`&&] operator groups left-to-right.

[:en]
The operands are both contextually converted to [`bool] (Clause [#conv]).

[:en]
The result is [`true] if both operands are [`true] and [`false] otherwise.

[:en]
Unlike [`&], [`&&] guarantees left-to-right evaluation: the second operand is
not evaluated if the first operand is [`false].

[para]
[:en]
The result is a [`bool].

[:en]
[%operator[!side effects and logical AND]]
If the second expression is evaluated, every [%value computation] value
computation and [%side effects] side effect associated with the first expression
is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the
second expression.
