[:en]
The [`||] operator groups left-to-right.

[:en]
The operands are both contextually converted to [`bool] (Clause [#conv]).

[:en]
It returns [`true] if either of its operands is [`true], and [`false] otherwise.

[:en]
Unlike [`|], [`||] guarantees left-to-right evaluation; moreover, the second
operand is not evaluated if the first operand evaluates to [`true].

[para]
[:en]
The result is a [`bool].

[%operator[!side effects and logical OR]]
If the second expression is evaluated, every [%value computation] value
computation and [%side effects] side effect associated with the first expression
is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the
second expression.
