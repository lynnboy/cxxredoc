[para]
[:en] The header [`<fstream>] defines four class templates and eight types that
associate stream buffers with files and assist reading and writing files.

[para]
[:en] In this subclause, the type name [`FILE] refers to the type [`FILE]
declared in [%@library <cstdio> [sortas cstdio]] [`<cstdio>] ([#c.files]).

[para]
[enter:note]
[:en] The class template [`basic_filebuf] treats a file as a source or sink of
bytes.

[:en] In an environment that uses a large character set, the file typically
holds multibyte character sequences and the [`basic_filebuf] object converts
those multibyte sequences into wide character sequences.
