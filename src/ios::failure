[para]
[:en] The class [`failure] defines the base class for the types of all objects
thrown as exceptions, by functions in the iostreams library, to report errors
detected during stream buffer operations.

[para]
[:en] When throwing [`ios_base::failure] exceptions, implementations should
provide values of [`ec] that identify the specific reason for the failure.

[enter:note]
[:en] Errors arising from the operating system would typically be reported as
[`system_category()] errors with an error value of the error number reported by
the operating system.

[:en] Errors arising from within the stream library would typically be reported
as [`error_code(io_errc::stream, iostream_category())].
