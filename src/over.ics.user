    [:en] User-defined conversion sequences
]

[para]
[:en]
A user-defined conversion sequence consists of an initial standard conversion
sequence followed by a user-defined conversion ([#class.conv]) followed by a
second standard conversion sequence.

[:en]
If the user-defined conversion is specified by a constructor
([#class.conv.ctor]), the initial standard conversion sequence converts the
source type to the type required by the argument of the constructor.

[:en]
If the user-defined conversion is specified by a conversion function
([#class.conv.fct]), the initial standard conversion sequence converts the
source type to the implicit object parameter of the conversion function.

[para]
[:en]
The second standard conversion sequence converts the result of the user-defined
conversion to the target type for the sequence.

[:en]
Since an implicit conversion sequence is an initialization, the special rules
for initialization by user-defined conversion apply when selecting the best
user-defined conversion for a user-defined conversion sequence (see
[#over.match.best] and [#over.best.ics]).

[para]
[:en]
If the user-defined conversion is specified by a specialization of a conversion
function template, the second standard conversion sequence shall have exact
match rank.

[para]
[:en]
A conversion of an expression of class type to the same class type is given
Exact Match rank, and a conversion of an expression of class type to a base
class of that type is given Conversion rank, in spite of the fact that a
constructor (i.e., a user-defined conversion function) is called for those
cases.
