[:en] This annex lists each section label and the corresponding section number,
in alphabetical order by label. All of the section labels are the same as in the
2003 standard, except:

[list]
[item]
[:en] labels that begin with [`lib.] in the 2003 standard have had the [`lib.]
removed so that they do not all appear in the same part of this list.

[:en] For example, in the 2003 standard, the non-modifying sequence algorithms
were found in a section with the label [`[lib.alg.nonmodifying`]].

[:en] The label for that section is now [`[alg.nonmodifying`]].

[item]
[:en] the label for Annex [#implimits] has been changed from [`[limits`]] to
[`[implimits`]].

[:en] The label [`[limits`]] refers to section [#limits].
